    <p>
      Front end application development is primarily based on HTML, CSS and
      Javascript languages. <br />
      Here we are trying to learn these languages to develop some basic HTML
      webpages for practice and implement them on AWS Amplify service.
    </p>
    <p>Let us go through each of them in detail!!</p>

    <h2 id="section-html">HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language - it is a markup language that is used for
      defining the building blocks of a webpage. The landing page file should be
      always named as <em class="filename">index.html</em> and the first line of
      html file should be &lt;!DOCTYPE html &gt; <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is not a case senstive language except for DOCTYPE which is usually
      always used in uppercase letters.
      <br />
      HTML contains elements most of which contains opening and closing tabs
      like for <em class="tag">head</em> and <em class="tag">body</em> elements.
      <br />
      There are elements that does not have closing tags for example
      <em class="tag">img</em>. The elements that can have child elements within
      itslef will have closing tag and since the image element is not allowed to
      have any child elements it doesnot end with closing tag like
      &lt;/img&gt;<br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 id="section-htmlsections">HTML sections</h3>
    <p>
      There are two main sections of HTML document - Head and body. <br />
      Head section is used to give the browser information about the web page
      like what is the title of the webpage, styling details, etc.
      <br />
      Body section contains the information that is displayed on the webpage.
      <br />
      This contains the paragraphs, headings and other details. <br />
      There are 6 heading types in HTML and it is to be noted that each webpage
      should contain only one H1 heading and the headings represent the
      hierarchy of the document, they should not be used just to leverage their
      font size since each heading tag can be customized using CSS.
    </p>
    <h3 id="section-links">Hyperlinks</h3>
    <p>
      Link and hyperlink are two terms that are often use interchangebly but
      they are different. By definition links are just an address or URL
      location of the target page, and hyperlinks are the elements the user can
      click on the page to navigate to that target webpage. <br />
      Hyperlinks are links to other pages or websites provided within this
      webpage. Usually they can be created to other pages, external webpages,
      images, etc. To create these hyperlinks on the html page we use anchor
      element which is represented as &lt;a href=""&gt;
      <br />
      Here <em class="tag">href</em> stands for Hypertext reference and contains
      the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for the other websites.
      <br />
      Href can contain two types of paths - relative link and absolute links.
      Relative link paths can be used when we want to navigate to a webpage
      within our local directories or system. For example, I have created
      another page to discuss CSS in detail which can be accessed by this link
      <a href="/css.html">CSS</a>. Here the href conatins value as follows -
      href = "/css.html".
      <br />
      However, if we want to jump to external websites then the link should
      start with protocol like https or http. For example, if i want to open new
      google window, i have to specify the link as follows - href =
      "https://google.com". And to open the link in a new tab we have to sepcify
      another attribute called target to "_blank".
      <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google Page</a>
    </p>
    <a href="#">Jump to Top</a>
